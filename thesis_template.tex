\acknowledgments
First, I would like to thank my academic advisors Dr. Beno\^{i}t Roux and Dr. Tobin Sosnick for their guidance throughout my thesis project. The nature of my thesis project was highly explorative, and without their patience and excellent guidance, this project would not have been able to be completed and fluorish. I really appreciate them both for giving me the intellectual freedom to learn how to be creative and teach me how to be a good scientist.

I would also like to thank my thesis committee members Dr. Eduardo Perozo and Dr. Andrei Tokmakoff for their insightful suggestions and discussions regarding my project. Specifically, I would like to thank Eduardo for his help with my understanding of membrane protein biochemistry better and I would like to thank Andrei for helping me understand protein kinetics better.

I have been extremely blessed with helpful and talented lab members, and especially, Yiling Zhang, Jing Li, Younghoon Koh, Michael Baxa, Adam Zmyslowski, Josh Riback

The University of Chicago Biophysics program has been invaluable to me, providing financial support as well as many friendships that will last throughout life. Michele Wittels, Julie Feder and Adam Hammond have provided me with assistance and constant support to ease. Eugene Leypunskiy, Herman Gudjonson, Vaughn Spurrier, and Boleslaw Osinski provided me with invaluable support and friendships throughout my tenure at the University of Chicago. I would not have been able to finish the work without their support

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family members Louesa Song, Dr. Byung Ho Song, Jeungen Yu, Bruce Akin, Dr. Renea Akin and Kelly Song for their constant support throughout life and 

\abstract

This thesis connects the dynamics of Kv1.2 and KcsA potassium channel pore domain monomers to the kinetics of tetramerization. In simulations, monomers adopt multiple conformations with the three helices folded. NMR studies also find the monomers to be dynamic and structurally heterogeneous. However, a KcsA construct with a disulfide bridge engineered between the two transmembrane helices has an NMR spectrum with well-dispersed peaks, suggesting that the monomer can be locked into a native-like conformation. During tetramerization, FRET results indicate that monomers rapidly oligomerize upon insertion into liposomes, likely forming a dense protein-rich phase. Folding within this protein-rich phase occurs along separate fast and slow routes, with f ~ 40 and 1500 seconds, respectively. In contrast, constructs bearing the disulfide bond mainly fold via the faster pathway, suggesting that maintaining the TM helices in their native orientation reduces misfolding. Interestingly, folding is concentration independent in spite of the tetrameric nature of the channel, indicating that the rate-limiting step is unimolecular and occurs after monomer association in protein-rich phase. Finally, despite its name, the addition of KcsA’s C-terminal “tetramerization” domain does not improve the kinetics of tetramerization.
