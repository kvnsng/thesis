First, I would like to thank my academic advisors Dr. Beno\^{i}t Roux and Dr. Tobin Sosnick for their guidance throughout my thesis project. The nature of my thesis project was highly explorative, and without their patience and excellent guidance, this project would not have been able to be completed and fluorish. I really appreciate them both for giving me the intellectual freedom to learn how to be creative and teach me how to be a good scientist. \par

I would also like to thank my thesis committee members Dr. Eduardo Perozo and Dr. Andrei Tokmakoff for their insightful suggestions and discussions regarding my project. Specifically, I would like to thank Eduardo for his help with my understanding of membrane protein biochemistry better and I would like to thank Andrei for helping me understand protein kinetics better. \par

For many potassium channels, tetramerization domains in either N- or C-terminal of the pore domain are thought to assist in tetrameric assembly by increasing local concentrations of monomer subunits. However, the pore domain, containing two transmembrane and a re-entrant pore helix, by itself form tetramers. Here, we investigate how the structural dynamics of monomers and tetramerization domains affect tetramer assembly of the potassium channels. Using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, Markov State Modeling (MSM), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and a gel-based refolding assay, we find that wild-type (WT) potassium channel monomers exist in a partially disordered state and this affects kinetics and thermodynamics of tetramerization. MSM for the monomer simulations show that ~80\% of the population having the two transmembrane helices separated. We introduce 2 cysteine mutations at the bottom of each of these helices to lock them in a native-like arrangement. A [1H, 15N]-TROSY-HSQC NMR spectrum of WT monomer in bicelles is poor due to aggregation and heterogeneity; however, the disulfide mutant shows a spectrum with well-dispersed peaks, suggesting that the disulfide mutant retains a native-like spectrum with limited heterogeneity on NMR time-scale. We perform a refolding study in liposomes and find that the kinetics is faster and the yield of tetramers is higher in the disulfide bonded native-like mutant. We suggest that WT monomers behave as partially disordered states in the bilayer with a high proclivity to misfold due to stable non-native helical tetramerization. The rate limiting step for the disulfide mutant is concentration independent suggesting that folding is limited by a unimolecular events such as insertion of the pore helix into a tetramer formed by the eight transmembrane helices. Refolding of full-length KcsA monomers is concentration dependent and addition of the tetramerization domain hinders the folding of disulfide mutant. We suggest that the tetramerization domain is for selectivity rather than stability of tetramers.
